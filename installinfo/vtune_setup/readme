vtune: Error: Cannot start data collection because the scope of ptrace system call is limited. To enable profiling, please set /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope to 0. To make this change permanent, set kernel.yama.ptrace_scope to 0 in /etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf and reboot the machine.

You're seeing this error because VTune requires permission to attach to a running process, and on modern Linux systems (including WSL), this is restricted by the ptrace_scope setting for security reasons.

Here's how you can resolve this in WSL:
✅ Temporary fix (until reboot):

Run the following command in your WSL Ubuntu terminal:

echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope

    This temporarily sets ptrace_scope to 0, allowing VTune to attach to processes.

✅ Permanent fix (survives reboot):

    Open the file (or create it if it doesn't exist):

sudo nano /etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf

    Add the following line (or change if it already exists):

kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 0

    Save and exit (Ctrl + O, Enter, then Ctrl + X)

    Apply changes immediately without reboot:

sudo sysctl --system

✅ Verify the current value:

cat /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope

It should output:

0


// ----------------------------------------------

The warning you're seeing from Intel VTune:

    vtune: Warning: Only user space will be profiled due to credentials lack. Consider changing /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid file for enabling kernel space profiling.

means that VTune is restricted from collecting kernel-level performance data due to current system security settings.

✅ Permanent fix (persists after reboot):

Edit the sysctl config:

sudo nano /etc/sysctl.d/10-perf.conf

Add this line at the end (or create the file if it doesn’t exist):

kernel.perf_event_paranoid = 0

Then apply the change:

sudo sysctl --system

✅ Verify current setting:

cat /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid

Should show 0 after applying the fix.

Let me know if you're using WSL, and I’ll tailor the instructions (some settings may be overridden by Windows on WSL startup).

Source the Environment Script

To make the vtune command available, you need to set environment variables by sourcing the script:

source /opt/intel/oneapi/vtune/latest/env/vars.sh

Now try:

vtune --help

If this works, then VTune is installed correctly.
ðŸ”¹ 3. Make It Permanent (Optional)

To avoid sourcing every time, add the line below to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:

source /opt/intel/oneapi/vtune/latest/env/vars.sh

Then reload your shell:

source ~/.bashrc

ðŸ”¹ 4. Try Profiling

Now, try profiling your executable:

vtune -collect hotspots -result-dir vtune_result ./your_executable

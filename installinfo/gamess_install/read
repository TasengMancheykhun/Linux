# Modifying GAMESS-US for HF calculation

## keep original gamess.00.x 
> cp gamess.00.x gamess.00.original

> cd ~/gamess/source/
> edit int1.src, Search for comment 'PRASHANT' and make the needed changes
> edit int2a.src, Search for comment 'ALKIT' and make the needed changes
> edit prpel.src, Search for comment 'ALKIT' and make the needed changes

> ./compall  

  To catch error, you can try 
  Example:- ./compall >&compall.log&       and look for error in this log file


> ./lked gamess 00
  Note: If there is any mistake, then on linking, new modified gamess.00.x will not be created
  


> Try running a job 
  > rungms h.inp >&h.out&

  Note: NPRINT=3   prints out property and 1e-integrals 
        NPRINT=4   prints out 2e-integrals

  > In ~/scr/, you find ---> dipole.txt  h.dat  onelec.txt  twelc.txt 

> cp gamess.00.x gamess.00.hf

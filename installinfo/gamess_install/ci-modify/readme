1) gugdga.prs is for creating hci.txt and transform Hartree Fock atomic orbital 
   to ci molecular orbital of files like dipole.txt and other integrals 

2) int1.prs contains in it code that transforms 
   one-electron AO integral to MO for ci,
   CAP AO integral to MO for ci, and 
   Dipole AO integral to MO for ci
   (Uncomment accordingly to convert what is needed)   
   

To get CAP in CI in stratch folder, Do this... 
In scratch folder, Put CAP obtained in AO as com.txt and run gamess.
This will create hci.txt in scratch. This is the cap in CI.

To make the gamess.00.x of this, in source, modification in 
specific places should be done as in the files gugdga.prs 
and int1.prs. This must be done in gugdga.src and int1.src files
in /gamess/source folder.(Always edit in the specific places in the source
files. Do not copy and paste these .prs in the source folder. This is 
because gamess version may be different.)  


To get Nondipole terms in CI in stratch folder, put nondipole integrals 
obtained in AO as dipole.txt and run gamess. This will create hci.txt in scratch. 
This is the nondipole integral in CI. Note that Nondipole integrals are 
complex numbers. So, put real part one time and imaginary part other time.
